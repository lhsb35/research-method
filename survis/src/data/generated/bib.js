        "abstract": "As technology continues to advance, chatbots are likely to become an increasingly vital tool in education. This study digs further into how students perceive and accept chatbots for use in learning activities. The study examines the integrated relationships between the constructs of the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the constructs of the value-based model (VAM), including perceived enjoyment, perceived risk, and perceived value, to predict students\u2019 attitudes and, consequently, their acceptance of chatbots for learning in higher education. A total of 432 respondents participated in an online survey, and the proposed hypotheses were evaluated through structural equation modeling (SEM-PLS). The study offers useful insights on chatbot adoption in Saudi higher education, as the results highlight important drivers of chatbot acceptance among students, including perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude, perceived enjoyment, and perceived value. Perceived risk was not a significant predictor of students\u2019 attitudes or their acceptance of chatbot use in learning. The results are expected to foster the adoption of chatbot technology in supporting distance learning in Saudi Arabia\u2019s higher education.",

The authors treat a concept of an educational chatbot in foreign language teaching. It is given a description of the technical characteristics of an educational chatbot creation and development. Their varieties, advantages and disadvantages are also analyzed. It is claimed that chatbots can realize both administrative and educational functions in educational process. Based on the analysis of existing platforms, they are described the stages of students' work on the development of foreign language speech skills during the interaction with chatbots. Methodological recommendations for the structure of a chatbot as an educational platform are proposed. It is concluded that the use of educational chatbots will allow students to work out the learned patterns and speech models, will help to form the skills of correspondence in social networks and messengers. All these factors will contribute to overcoming the psychological barrier which students experience at the beginning of the real foreign language communication.",

        "abstract": "A conversational chatbot or dialogue system is a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the Internet. These chatbots can be integrated into messaging apps, mobile apps, or websites, and are designed to engage in natural language conversations with users. There are also many applications in which chatbots are used for educational support to improve students\u2019 performance during the learning cycle. The recent success of ChatGPT also encourages researchers to explore more possibilities in the field of chatbot applications. One of the main benefits of conversational chatbots is their ability to provide an instant and automated response, which can be leveraged in many application areas. Chatbots can handle a wide range of inquiries and tasks, such as answering frequently asked questions, booking appointments, or making recommendations. Modern conversational chatbots use artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, such as natural language processing (NLP) and artificial neural networks, to understand and respond to users\u2019 input. In this study, we will explore the objectives of why chatbot systems were built and what key methodologies and datasets were leveraged to build a chatbot. Finally, the achievement of the objectives will be discussed, as well as the associated challenges and future chatbot development trends.",

In addition to the challenge of providing personalized learning experiences for students, these technologies can increase the workload of instructors due to the maintenance and updates required to keep the courses up-to-date. Intelligent chatbots based on generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology can help overcome these disadvantages by transforming pedagogical activities and guiding both students and instructors interactively. In this study, we explore and compare the main characteristics of existing educational chatbots. Then, we propose a new theoretical framework for blended learning with intelligent chatbots integration enabling students to interact online and instructors to create and manage their courses using generative AI tools. The advantages of the proposed framework are as follows: (1) it provides a comprehensive understanding of the transformative potential of AI chatbots in education and facilitates their effective implementation; (2) it offers a holistic methodology to enhance the overall educational experience; and (3) it unifies the applications of intelligent chatbots in teaching\u2013learning activities within universities.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into education, particularly for Personalized Language Learning (PLL), has garnered significant attention. This approach tailors interventions to address the unique challenges faced by individual learners. Large Language Models (LLMs), including Chatbots, have demonstrated a substantial potential in automating and enhancing educational tasks, effectively capturing the complexity and diversity of human language. In this study, 52 foreign language students were randomly divided into two groups: one with the assistance of a Chatbot based on LLMs and one without. Both groups learned the same series of target words over eight weeks. Post-treatment assessments, including systematic observation and quantitative tests assessing both receptive and productive vocabulary knowledge, were conducted immediately after the study and again two weeks later. The findings demonstrate that employing an AI Chatbot based on LLMs significantly aids students in acquiring both receptive and productive vocabulary knowledge during their second language learning journey. Notably, Chatbots contribute to the long-term retention of productive vocabulary and facilitate incidental vocabulary learning. This study offers valuable insights into the practical benefits of LLM-based tools in language learning, with a specific emphasis on vocabulary development. Chatbots utilizing LLMs emerge as effective language learning aids. It emphasizes the importance of educators understanding the potential of these technologies in L2 vocabulary instruction and encourages the adoption of strategic teaching methods incorporating such tools.",
